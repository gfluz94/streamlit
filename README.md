### Streamlit: Front-End Made Easy

Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. It turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.

In order to install it, we can just use `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

A quick intro to the library can be visualized with the following command:

```bash
streamlit hello
``` 

Once you have written your python script, a single command exhibits your web app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
